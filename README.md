# ECE-387-Midterm-Project

Project Proposal: This project is using the MeArm from Hackaday. For my midterm, I will construct the crane and program the four servo motors so the crane can operate. After the initial construction, I plan to design the crane to play a C Tetrachord (this consists of the notes C, D, E, and F) on the piano.
