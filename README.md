# ECE-387-Midterm-Project
This project is using the MeArm from Hackaday. For my midterm, I will construct the crane and program the four servo motors so the crane can operate. After the initial construction, I plan to design the crane to either play chess, or  to play a scale on the marimba. This will be determined based on the strength of the material (as in if the material is strong enough to hold a marimba mallet, I will design it to play scales).
